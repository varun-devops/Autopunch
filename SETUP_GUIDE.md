## 🎯 **What This System Does**

✅ **Automatically logs into your website at 10:00 AM IST**  
✅ **Clicks the "Punch In" button**  
✅ **Automatically logs in again at 6:00 PM IST**  
✅ **Clicks the "Punch Out" button**  
✅ **Sends you a detailed email report to varunparihar994@gmail.com**  
✅ **Saves daily logs and takes screenshots**  

## 🚀 **Current Status**

✅ **Browser Automation**: WORKING - Successfully logs in and finds buttons  
✅ **Punch In/Out Detection**: WORKING - Correctly identifies left/right buttons  
✅ **Email System**: WORKING - Email reports are being generated  
✅ **Scheduling**: READY - Set for 10 AM and 6 PM IST

## 📧 **Email System**

The system uses a test email service that creates preview URLs. The emails contain:
- Daily punch report with in/out times
- Total working hours calculation
- Error notifications if something goes wrong

**Note**: The emails are currently sent via a test service. For production Gmail sending, you would need to:
1. Enable 2-factor authentication on your Gmail
2. Generate an app password
3. Update the email configuration

## ⚙️ **How to Run**

### **For Daily Automation (Production):**
```bash
npm start
```
This will:
- Start the scheduler
- Run punch in at 10:00 AM IST daily
- Run punch out at 6:00 PM IST daily
- Send email reports after each punch out

### **For Testing:**
```bash
# Test punch in only
npm run test-punch-in

# Test punch out only  
npm run test-punch-out

# Test full cycle (punch in + punch out + email)
npm run test-cycle

# Test email functionality only
npm run test-email
```
